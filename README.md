# Honda Civic Sales

This project uses a linear regression model to predict Civic sales in the U.S. from 2014 to 2024. 
The data split from 2014 to 2019 is used to train the model. 
Results from 2020–2024 are compared to the model’s predictions. 
I use p-values and VIF to find the best-fit model and add other variables to improve prediction.
